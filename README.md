This project is a [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk), [Kernelsu](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU), [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) module for Clash/mihomo, sing-box, v2ray, xray, hysteria. It supports REDIRECT (TCP only), TPROXY (TCP + UDP) transparent proxy, TUN (TCP + UDP), and hybrid mode REDIRECT (TCP) + TUN (UDP) proxy.

Based on upstream integration for one-stop service, ready to use. Suitable for:
- Lazy people
- Beginners

The project's theme and configuration focus on [Clash/mihomo.Meta](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/Clash.Meta).

This module needs to be used in a Magisk/Kernelsu environment. If you don't know how to configure the required environment, you might need applications like ClashForAndroid, v2rayNG, surfboard, SagerNet, AnXray.

## Wiki

<details>
<summary>1. First Use</summary>

- After installing the module for the first time, **please first** add your subscription URL to `/data/adb/box_bll/clash/config.yaml`, and then manually restart the device once.
- Due to network reasons, the **rules**/**subscriptions** may not be fully downloaded automatically. Please manually refresh the panel.
  - If the above fails, ensure your network environment is normal.
- After the configuration and node fetching are complete, go to: 
- **Settings** ‚Üí **Search Box**, and search for the keyword "DNS." If similar options appear, select them:
  - Private DNS
  - Dedicated DNS
- And configure the custom domain:
```text
1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com
```

- Web App:
  - It is purely a graphical tool for portable browsing and managing backend routing data, with no other unnecessary uses.
  - If you encounter a **connection failed** request or the proxy group icons are not displayed, you can try turning the network off/on, or check if you can access `raw.githubusercontent.com`.

> The module has an integrated GUI that can be accessed locally via a browser or online via the app. The two are essentially the same.

<summary>3. Routing Rules</summary>

GitHub Actions automatically builds at 6 AM Beijing Time every day to ensure the CN rules are up to date. [Wiki](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/meta-rules-dat)

> The routing rules are all linked online and automatically updated every 24 hours.

<details>
<summary>4. Subsequent Updates</summary>

- If you are using the default configuration, updates will be seamless.
- The module supports online updates in the client, and no restart is required after the update. The module switch control (enable/disable) ~~may temporarily fail and still require a restart~~, or you can use Toolbox for updates (not recommended, as script updates may not be timely).
- During updates, the configuration file will be backed up to:
   - `config.yaml.bak`
- User configuration will be backed up during the update to:
   - `box.config.bak`
- Your subscription URL will be automatically extracted and backed up to:
   - `subscribe_urls_backup.txt`
   - The backup will be automatically extracted and restored to the new configuration, suitable for those using the default configuration file.

- Module updates do not include:
   - Geo database files
   - Bin files
   - Web resources

> Ps: The update mainly follows upstream updates and delivers some configurations.

<summary>5. Usage Issues</summary>

1. Proxy Specific Applications (Black/Whitelist)
- To proxy all applications except certain ones, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, set the `proxy_mode` value to `blacklist` (default), and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array. The format for elements is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces. For example, `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")` to **not proxy** specific Android user applications.

- To only proxy specific applications, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, set the `proxy_mode` value to `whitelist`, and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array. The format for elements is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces. For example, `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")` to **only proxy** specific Android user applications.

Android user group ID identifiers:

| Standard User | ID  |
| ------------- | --- |
| Owner         |  0  |
| Second Space  |  10 |
| App Clone     | 999 |

> Typically, you can find all user group IDs and application package names in `/data/user/`. Do not use fake-ip mode when using black/whitelist.

2. Tun Mode
- ~~Enabled by default~~
- Deprecated in v7.4.3

> If necessary, you can manually enable it. Please do not use the whitelist/blacklist before using this mode.

3. Routing Rules
- Designed for mainland China usage
- Sufficient for most daily needs

> If there are no strict requirements, the whitelist/blacklist is not very meaningful, and the default configuration of the module is enough.

4. Panel Management
- Magisk Font Module

> May affect normal display of page fonts.

5. LAN Sharing
- Enable hotspot to allow other devices to connect.

> If other devices need to access the console backend, just use (http://Current WiFi Gateway:9090/ui).

6. Private DNS
- **When enabled**, please **ensure the module service is running properly**, **otherwise**, it may affect CN resolution and result in **no internet connection**.
- This is an optional feature ‚úÖ
- It is recommended to enable it.

> This is to fully solve some IPv6 DNS request leaks under Wan0.

7. Host File
- No need to mount
   - Just delete the file.
- To remount
   - Create a new file in the `etc` folder.
- All modifications take effect immediately.

> Domain IP redirection.
